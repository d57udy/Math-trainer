**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, along with a proposed system architecture, for a Math Training Game. The game aims to help school children practice basic arithmetic operations in an engaging and rewarding way.

### 1.2 Scope
The system will include generating math problems based on user settings, accepting user input, providing immediate feedback, tracking progress and speed, awarding achievements, managing a list of problems needing practice, and offering timed gameplay sessions.

### 1.3 Target Audience
School children (e.g., grades 1-6, adaptable based on settings). The user interface and feedback mechanisms should be age-appropriate, clear, and encouraging.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements (FR)

### FR1: Equation Generation
1.1. The system must generate single math equations involving two operands and one operator (e.g., `a + b = ?`).
1.2. The type of operator(s) used (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) must be configurable based on user settings (see FR7.1).
1.3. The numerical values of operands must fall within a user-defined minimum and maximum range (see FR7.2).
1.4. The system must optionally include negative numbers for operands and results, based on user settings (see FR7.3). If disabled, all operands and results must be non-negative.
1.5. The system must optionally include fractions as operands, based on user settings (see FR7.4). Calculations involving fractions should result in simplified fractional answers where appropriate or potentially mixed numbers.
    > **Decision Point:** How should fraction answers be input/displayed? (e.g., a/b, mixed numbers?) *Assumption: Simple fractions (a/b) for input/display initially.*
1.6. The system must optionally include real (decimal) numbers as operands, based on user settings (see FR7.5).
    > **Decision Point:** How many decimal places? *Assumption: Up to 2 decimal places initially.*
1.7. **Crucially:** The result of the generated equation must also fall within the user-defined minimum and maximum range (FR1.3) and adhere to the negative number setting (FR1.4). This prevents questions like `5 + 8 = ?` if the max range is 10, or `3 - 5 = ?` if negative numbers are disabled.
1.8. For division, the system should initially generate problems with exact integer results unless fractions or real numbers are enabled. If fractions/real numbers are enabled, the division results should conform to those settings. Avoid division by zero.

### FR2: User Interaction & Feedback
2.1. The system must display the generated equation clearly to the user, prompting for an answer (e.g., `"5 + 8 = "`).
2.2. The system must provide an input field for the user to enter their numerical answer. Input validation should ensure only valid characters (numbers, potentially `-`, `/`, `.`) are entered based on settings.
2.3. Upon answer submission, the system must immediately check if the entered answer is mathematically correct.
2.4. The system must provide clear, immediate visual and/or textual feedback indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect (e.g., "Correct!", "Try Again!", checkmark, X).
2.5. If the answer was incorrect, the system should display the correct answer.

### FR3: Progress Tracking & Statistics
3.1. For each unique equation presented, the system must track:
    3.1.1. The total number of times the user has answered it correctly.
    3.1.2. The time taken for each correct solve (measured from question presentation to correct answer submission).
    3.1.3. Potentially store the fastest time for each equation.
3.2. This tracking data must persist between game sessions.

### FR4: Award System
4.1. Based on the number of times a specific equation has been solved correctly (FR3.1.1), the system shall assign an award level to that equation:
    *   **Threshold 1** (e.g., 3 correct solves): Silver Award
    *   **Threshold 2** (e.g., 10 correct solves): Gold Award
    *   **Threshold 3** (e.g., 25 correct solves): Diamond Award
    *(These thresholds should be configurable internally or potentially in advanced settings).*
4.2. The system may visually indicate the award status of an equation when it is presented or listed.

### FR5: Training Mode ("Equations to Train")
5.1. If a user answers an equation incorrectly, that specific equation must be added to a persistent "Equations to Train" list (if not already present).
5.2. The user must be able to explicitly navigate to and view the "Equations to Train" list.
5.3. The user must be able to initiate a "Training Mode" session that cycles only through the equations currently in the "Equations to Train" list.
5.4. When an equation from the list is answered correctly during Training Mode, it must be removed from the "Equations to Train" list.
5.5. Progress tracking (FR3) and awards (FR4) should still apply to equations solved correctly in Training Mode.

### FR6: Regular Game Mode (Timed Challenge)
6.1. The user must be able to start a "Regular Game Mode" session.
6.2. In this mode, the system must present a continuous stream of randomly generated equations based on the current user settings (FR1). Equations should ideally not repeat too closely together within a single session.
6.3. A visible timer must be displayed during this mode.
6.4. When the Regular Game Mode starts, the timer must be reset to a predefined duration (e.g., 60 seconds).
    > **Decision Point:** Should timer duration be configurable? *(Add to settings - FR7.6)*.
6.5. A score counter must be displayed during this mode.
6.6. The score must be incremented (e.g., by 1) for each equation answered correctly within the time limit. Incorrect answers do not increment the score but should still trigger feedback (FR2.4) and potentially add the equation to the training list (FR5.1).
6.7. The game session automatically ends when the timer reaches zero.
6.8. Upon game end, the system must display the user's final score for that session.
6.9. The system should offer options after the game ends, such as "Play Again" (restarts timed mode) or "Main Menu".

### FR7: Settings Menu
7.1. The application must provide a dedicated Settings Menu accessible to the user.
7.2. **Operations Selection:** The menu must contain checkboxes allowing the user to enable/disable:
    *   Addition (+)
    *   Subtraction (-)
    *   Multiplication (*)
    *   Division (/)
    *(At least one operation must be selected for the game to function).*
7.3. **Number Range:** The menu must provide input fields for the user to define:
    *   Minimum Number (integer value)
    *   Maximum Number (integer value)
    *(Input validation needed: Min <= Max. These bounds apply to operands and the result).*
7.4. **Negative Numbers:** A checkbox to allow/disallow the use of negative numbers in operands and results.
7.5. **Fractions:** A checkbox to allow/disallow the use of fractions.
7.6. **Real Numbers (Decimals):** A checkbox to allow/disallow the use of decimal numbers.
7.7. **Timer Duration:** An input field or selection dropdown to set the duration (in seconds) for the Regular Game Mode timer (e.g., 30, 60, 90, 120 seconds). *(New based on FR6.4)*
7.8. All settings must persist between application sessions.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

### NFR1: Usability
The user interface must be intuitive, engaging, and easy to navigate for school children. Visual cues should be clear. Font sizes should be legible.

### NFR2: Performance
2.1. Feedback on answer correctness must be instantaneous (< 0.5 seconds).
2.2. Equation generation should be fast enough not to cause noticeable delays between questions (< 0.5 seconds).
2.3. The timer display must update smoothly.

### NFR3: Reliability
3.1. Answer checking logic must be accurate for all configured number types (integers, negatives, fractions, decimals).
3.2. Progress tracking and award assignment must be accurate.
3.3. The "Equations to Train" list mechanism must function correctly (adding on incorrect, removing on correct in training).

### NFR4: Persistence
User settings, progress data (correct counts, times, awards per equation), and the "Equations to Train" list must be saved locally on the user's device and loaded correctly when the application starts.

### NFR5: Maintainability
Code should be well-structured, commented, and organized to facilitate future updates and bug fixes.

### NFR6: Portability
*(Optional, depending on target platform)* Consider if the game needs to run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Web, Mobile). The choice of technology stack will influence this.

## 4. System Architecture

A layered architecture is suitable for this application, separating concerns:

### 4.1 Presentation Layer (UI)
*   **Responsibilities:** Renders the user interface, displays equations, feedback, timer, score, awards, lists, and settings options. Captures user input (button clicks, text entry).
*   **Components:**
    *   `MainMenuView`: Displays options like "Start Game", "Training", "Settings", "Exit".
    *   `GameView`: Displays the current equation, input field, timer, score, feedback area. Used for both Regular and Training modes.
    *   `SettingsView`: Displays all configuration options (checkboxes, input fields).
    *   `TrainingListView`: Displays the list of equations to be practiced.
    *   `ScoreSummaryView`: Displays the final score after a timed game.
    *   `InputWidgets`: Reusable components for number entry (handling integers, decimals, fractions).
    *   `FeedbackElements`: Visual/textual elements for correct/incorrect answers.

### 4.2 Application Logic / Game Engine Layer
*   **Responsibilities:** Orchestrates the game flow, manages game state, generates equations, checks answers, manages the timer, calculates scores, handles awards logic, manages the training list.
*   **Components:**
    *   `GameController`: Manages the overall game state (MainMenu, InGameRegular, InGameTraining, Settings, ScoreScreen). Handles transitions between states. Initiates game sessions.
    *   `EquationGenerator`: Creates valid `Equation` objects based on current `Settings`. Ensures operands and results adhere to all constraints (range, negatives, type, division rules).
    *   `AnswerChecker`: Compares user input with the correct answer of an `Equation`, considering potential floating-point inaccuracies or fraction representations.
    *   `Timer`: Manages the countdown timer for Regular Game Mode.
    *   `ScoreKeeper`: Tracks and updates the score during Regular Game Mode.
    *   `ProgressTracker`: Updates and manages the persistent data related to equation performance (correct counts, times, awards). Interacts with the Persistence Layer.
    *   `TrainingListManager`: Manages adding/removing equations from the "Equations to Train" list. Interacts with the Persistence Layer.

### 4.3 Data Layer
*   **Responsibilities:** Handles the storage and retrieval of persistent data (settings, progress, training list). Abstracts the underlying storage mechanism.
*   **Components:**
    *   `SettingsManager`: Loads and saves the user's configuration settings.
    *   `ProgressDataManager`: Loads and saves the statistics for each solved equation (counts, times, awards).
    *   `TrainingListStore`: Loads and saves the list of equations marked for training.
*   **Storage Mechanism:** Likely a local file (e.g., JSON, SQLite database, XML). JSON is often simple for this scale. SQLite offers more robust querying if complexity grows.

### 4.4 Key Data Structures

*   **`Settings`**: An object/struct holding all configurable parameters.
    ```
    // Example structure
    {
      minRange: number,
      maxRange: number,
      operations: { add: boolean, sub: boolean, mul: boolean, div: boolean },
      allowNegatives: boolean,
      allowFractions: boolean,
      allowDecimals: boolean,
      timerDuration: number // seconds
    }
    ```
*   **`Equation`**: An object/struct representing a math problem. Using an object is better than just strings for easier logic. The string representation (e.g., "5 + 8") can be generated for display and used as a key for tracking.
    ```
    // Example structure
    {
      operand1: number | Fraction | Decimal,
      operand2: number | Fraction | Decimal,
      operator: string, // e.g., '+', '-', '*', '/'
      correctResult: number | Fraction | Decimal,
      displayString: string // e.g., "5 + 8 = ?"
    }
    ```
*   **`EquationStats`**: An object/struct associated with a unique Equation string/ID.
    ```
    // Example structure
    {
      correctCount: number,
      fastestTime: number, // seconds or milliseconds
      currentAward: 'None' | 'Silver' | 'Gold' | 'Diamond'
    }
    ```
*   **`ProgressData`**: A dictionary/map where keys are Equation strings/IDs and values are `EquationStats` objects.
    ```
    // Example structure (Map/Dictionary)
    {
      "5 + 8": { correctCount: 15, fastestTime: 1.2, currentAward: 'Gold' },
      "12 - 3": { correctCount: 3, fastestTime: 2.5, currentAward: 'Silver' }
      // ... more equations
    }
    ```
*   **`TrainingList`**: A list or set containing unique Equation strings/IDs that need practice.
    ```
    // Example structure (Set or List)
    [ "3 * 4", "10 / 2" ]
    ```

### 4.5 Interactions (Example Flows)

    *   `AnswerChecker` returns Correct/Incorrect.
    *   `GameController` updates UI via `GameView` (feedback).
5.  **Correct Answer:**
    *   `GameController` notifies `ProgressTracker` (with equation and time).
    *   `ProgressTracker` updates stats, checks for Award changes, saves data via `ProgressDataManager`.
    *   `GameController` increments `ScoreKeeper` (if Regular Mode).
    *   `GameController` requests next `Equation`.
6.  **Incorrect Answer:**
    *   `GameController` notifies `TrainingListManager` (with equation).
    *   `TrainingListManager` adds to list, saves via `TrainingListStore`.
    *   `GameController` requests next `Equation`.
7.  **Timer End:**
    *   `Timer` notifies `GameController`.
    *   `GameController` transitions to `ScoreSummaryView`, displaying final score from `ScoreKeeper`.
8.  **Start Training:**
    *   `GameController` transitions state.
    *   `GameView` displayed.
    *   `GameController` requests next equation specifically from the `TrainingListManager`.
9.  **Correct Answer (Training):**
    *   Same as step 5, but additionally:
    *   `GameController` notifies `TrainingListManager` to remove the equation.
    *   `TrainingListManager` saves via `TrainingListStore`.

## 5. Technology Stack Considerations (Examples)

*   **Desktop:** Python (with Pygame, Kivy, or PyQt/PySide), Java (with Swing/JavaFX), C# (with WinForms/WPF/Unity).
*   **Web:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, or plain JS). Requires backend or local storage for persistence.
*   **Mobile:** Native (Swift/Kotlin), Cross-Platform (React Native, Flutter, Unity).

*The choice depends on the target platform, developer familiarity, and desired complexity.*

---

## 6. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements

*   User Profiles (multiple children using the same device).
*   More complex equations (e.g., multiple operations, parentheses).
*   Different visual themes.
*   Sound effects and background music.
*   Adaptive difficulty (adjusting number ranges or complexity based on performance).
*   More detailed statistics and progress visualization (graphs).
*   Online leaderboards (requires backend infrastructure).
*   Hint system.
